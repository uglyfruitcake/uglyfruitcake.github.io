displayed on the Readme of the repository so that everyone can see the winning
strategies. As of June 2015 there were 66 strategies submitted to
Axelrod-Python. The boxplot looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/strategies_boxplot_june_2015.png" alt="Strategies boxplot from
June 2015" style="width: 800px;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in June 2015 "Meta Hunter” was the current winning strategy on
Axelrod-Python. This strategy was one of the more complicated strategies of the
tournament. It worked by combining various “hunters” that hunted specific mean
strategies and defected against them. Individually these hunters did not perform
particularly well. However when combined as “Meta Hunter” it proved to be
extremely effective and was the winning strategy for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other strategy that even came close to “Meta Hunter” was “Fool me
Once”. This strategy was one of the most simple strategies in the tournament. It
cooperated unless the opponent had defected more than once. If the opponent had
defected more than once then it would defect forever. It was extremely simple
and yet very effective. Both of these strategies were “nice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance it may be easy to say that “Meta Hunter” and “Fool me Once” are
very different strategies. However on closer inspection they appear to be more
similar than you might think. “Meta Hunter” hunts individual mean strategies and
when it finds them it will defect forever. “Fool me Once” bypasses individual
strategies and will just generically defect against anything that defects
unprovoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be shown be how quickly the two strategies "detect" the mean
strategies. This table breaks down the individual strategies that "Meta Hunter"
hunts and shows the average number of turns it would take to detect them. It
also shows the average number of turns "Fool me Once" takes to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Defector&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Alternator&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Random&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Golden&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pi&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;e&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

found it very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axelrod-Python is a python project dedicated to recreating Robert Axelrod’s
original iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments in the 1980's. The Github
repository can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisoner's dilemma is a two player game theory exercise where both players have
the choice of defecting or cooperating. They do not know what the other player
will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they both cooperate they will both receive 3 points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they both defect they will both receive 1 point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one cooperates and one defects then the defector will receive 5 points and
the cooperator will receive 0 points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be defined by this payoff matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{pmatrix}
(1,1) &amp;amp; (5,0)\\
(0,5) &amp;amp; (3,3)\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the game is to maximise your score over 200 rounds. The only
information available to you is your opponent's history so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Axelrod-Python strategies are submitted as python code. Each strategy will
play every other in a tournament and the strategy with the highest average score
wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axelrod's original tournament was used to simulate evolution and investigate how
cooperation can evolve over time. This project aims to reproduce that work. You
can read about Axelrod's original tournaments and learn more about the
prisoner's dilemma

&lt;p&gt;Axelrod-Python is an open source project and so anyone can contribute. If you

strategies. Nice strategies will never defect before their opponent has defected
and so will never defect first. Hence if two nice strategies play each other,
the outcome will always be cooperation on every turn. This is called a
“cooperation cycle”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mean strategy is a strategy that may defect before the opponent. Any
randomised strategy is by definition mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a nice strategy is that when both players cooperate they
maximise their points as a pair. They receive 6 points overall, which is more
than any other situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean strategies will anger other strategies by defecting. If two strategies end
up defecting against each other on every turn it is called a “defection cycle”.
This is the worst possible outcome as the pair only receives 2 points overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore it is easy to see that a cooperation cycle is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his original tournaments Axelrod concluded that nice strategies will normally
outperform mean strategies. This is because the winner of both tournaments was
"Tit for Tat" which was a nice strategy. Tit for Tat worked by cooperating on
the first round and then copying the opponents last decision. It was a very
simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
